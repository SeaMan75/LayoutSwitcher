# LayoutSwitcher
The simplest layout switcher
***
The utility loads into the system tray and monitors keyboard input.  
- Releasing the **left Ctrl key** switches the input layout to **Russian**.  
- Releasing the **right Ctrl key** switches it to **English**.  

This behavior can be disabled via the context menu in the system tray.  

When launching the application from the command line, you can pass one of the following arguments:  
- `r` — switch to Russian input layout  
- `e` — switch to English input layout  

The program has no configuration settings — everything is hardcoded.
